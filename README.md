#Quick presentation of me and the project.

Hi ! I'm Teddy, a junior developper, who's currently studying in the great school ESGI.

The C language is one of my favorite because you must be carefull about every commas and syntaxes written in your code, so it forces you to be very rigorous.

The work i had to do was to create a dictionary which contains words, which would be a data base of forbidden words.
The main activity of this program is to chat with the machine and then he will repeat your sentence and will censor every word of your sentence with '*'.

My teacher asked us to create a predefined array of words and then we could chat with it but it would be too easy and boring. So i gave myself some challenges.

First, I'll create a library, which contains books, which also contain words in it.
Secondly, I can add as much books and words as I want.
Thirdly, I can delete as much books and words as I want too.
And then finally, I'm going to make it complicated.

What I mean by complicated is : 
Obviously, if you want to do the job fast and easy, you can just create pointers of strings and then realloc the size every time you add or remove things.
But I'll do linked list.

Enjoy my code.
You're free to use it as much as you want.

Things to do : 
- Clean the code
- Correct all segmentation fault caused by a pattern of action.
